### Tutorials
https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/authentication-and-security/credentials-validation/

### Usage

1. Use either Maven, MobileFirst CLI or your IDE of choice to [build and deploy the available `ResourceAdapter` and `PinCodeAttempts` adapters](https://mobilefirstplatform.ibmcloud.com/tutorials/en/foundation/8.0/adapters/creating-adapters/).

 The PinCodeAttempts Security Check adapter can be found in https://github.com/MobileFirst-Platform-Developer-Center/SecurityCheckAdapters/tree/release80.

2. From a command-line window, navigate to the project's root folder and run the commands:
 - `pod update` followed by `pod install` - to add the MobileFirst SDK.
 - `mfpdev app register` - to register the application.
 - `mfpdev app push` - to map the `accessRestricted` scope to the `PinCodeAttempts` security check.

3. Run the application in the iOS Simulator or physical device. Press the **Get Balance** button and enter "1234" to display the balance.

> **Tip:** you can update the bundled SDK by running the command `pod update` from the project's root folder.
